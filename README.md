# Computational-Physics
Numerical Solutions to a few of famous Physics problems

For every tutorial, there are two problems we solve numerically. You can find these problems on a pdf named 'tut#' where '#' indicates the tutorial number.
These solutions are my own solutions and I don't claim any of them to be correct.

You can find Jypiter notebooks for the full documentation and Physics related to the problem and solution for each Tutorial.
